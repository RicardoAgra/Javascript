# Introduction

This repo is meant to explain how javascript works. There will be numerous files containing explanations, along with demonstrations, about a specific topic.

You are incentivised to compile and run the code. For that, its recommend installing [NodeJs](https://www.nodejs.org). After installing, you can run the files by navigating to the folder where they are located and type

    $ node filename.js

Other options would be to use an [online javascript compiler](https://repl.it/repls/LuckyCanineKestrel) or simply include the files in an HTML document

    <script src="filename.js">

Open the HTML document in a browser and check the javascript console under developer tools.

## Goals

It is intended to demonstrate the most relevant aspects of the programming language in a simple to understand manner.

The project does not have a timeline though, so it might be a while between updates.

Comments and feedback are highly appreciated, so feel free to leave an issue, clone, etc...
