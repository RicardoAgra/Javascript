# Introduction

This repo is meant to explain how javascript works. There will be numerouse files containing explanations, along with demonstrations, about a specific topic.

You are incentivised to compile and run the code. For that, its recomend installing [NodeJs](https://www.nodejs.org). After installing, you can run the files by navigating to the folder where they are located and type

    node filename.js

Other options would be to use an [online javascript compiler](https://repl.it/repls/LuckyCanineKestrel) or simply include the files in an HTML document

    <script scr="filename.js">

Open the HTML document in a browser and check the javascript console under developer tools.

## Goals

It is intended to demonstrate the most relevant aspects of the programming language in a simple to understand manner.
